1. Why did you chose to use react?
    I mainly choose to use React because it's fast and provide us to create reusable components, but also because it's easier to create a dynamic and well optimized web application with React.

2. What measures do you use to know popularity ?
    To measure popularity, I'm checking numbers of stars, forks and watchers, which is giving me a first idea of popularity of a project.
    I also check on Stackoverflow if there is a lot of people which are talking about the project and helping each others.

3. What is more popular, React or Vue ?
    Currently (02/2022), Vue is just little more popular than React based on stars, but they're pretty equals in term of popularity.
